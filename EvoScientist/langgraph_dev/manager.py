"""langgraph dev lifecycle management for background agent support.

Provides functions to start/stop/health-check a ``langgraph dev`` subprocess
that hosts the EvoScientist main agent, async sub-agents (e.g.
``writing-agent``), and EvoMemory background workers. The CLI calls
``ensure_langgraph_dev(config, ...)`` at startup so users can run
``EvoSci -p "..."`` without manually managing the langgraph dev server.

Mirrors the lifecycle pattern used by ``ccproxy_manager.py``.
